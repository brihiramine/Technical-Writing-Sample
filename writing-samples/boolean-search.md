#### What are Boolean Search Commands
Boolean Search Commands (also known as Operators) can modify a search to deliver more specific results, thereby saving time and improving search efficiency. Using Indeed.com as an example, the search will focus on a specific role search: technical writing roles.

#### Commands and Usage
First, why use Boolean commands?
Boolean Search Commands provide the following key skills. 
   - Narrow or broaden a search
   - Filter a search to include phrases and key words
   - Combine multiple searches so one doesn't have to hunt for results independently 

But what are the commands, exactly?
Introducing the three most basic terms, known as operators:
**AND, OR,** and **NOT**
 - **AND** combines terms so that all the listed terms appear in the search result (*technical* **AND** *writer*)
 - **OR** combines terms so that at least one of the listed terms appears in the search result (*writer* **OR** *writing*)
 - **NOT** excludes the subsequent terms from the search result (writer **NOT** *tutoring*)

More powerful filtering techinques include _phrase_ and _query matching_ expressions.
 - **Phrase search** uses quotes around terms so that the exact phrase appears in the search result (**"**_technical writer_**"**) which is great for pinpointing the role you are looking for!
 - **Query matching** uses a query expression to limit search to a specific category, such as job title (**title:** _writer_) 

Combining these techniques, we can create very powerful examples. Checkout the search below and click the link to see it in action on the site ([Indeed link](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=title%3A%28%22technical+writer%22+OR+%22technical+editor%22%29++NOT+tutor&l=Seattle%2C+WA&sort=date)).
```
title:("technical writer" OR "technical editor")  NOT tutor
```

As you can see from this specific search, we have filtered unwanted words (tutor) that may pop up had we not employed this Boolean search command. To further strengthen your search, you could add more phrases or categories, ("entry level" OR "full time") NOT contract. 

Boolean search commands are pretty straightforward once you learn how to implement them in a specific search. These commands have been very useful to me personally in my job search - I hope they can assist you!
