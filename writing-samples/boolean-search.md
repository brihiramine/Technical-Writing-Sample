# How to Use Boolean Search to Find Your Next Job
**Author:** Bri Hiramine Latimer

Searching for a job is no easy task. On most job listing sites, there can be thousands of potential opportunities posted. This can prove overwhelming because a majority of the listings do not apply specifically to what you are looking for. One technique to filter out unwanted listings is to employ Boolean Search Commands. 
#### What are Boolean Search Commands?
Boolean Search Commands (also known as Operators) can modify a search to deliver more specific results, thereby saving time and improving search efficiency. Using Indeed.com as an example, the search will focus on a specific role search: technical writing roles.

#### Commands and Usage
First, why use Boolean commands?
Boolean Search Commands provide the following key skills. 
   - Narrow or broaden a search
   - Filter a search to include phrases and key words
   - Combine multiple searches so one doesn't have to hunt for results independently 

But what are the commands, exactly?
Introducing the three most basic commands, known as operators:
**AND, OR,** and **NOT**
 - **AND** combines terms so that all the listed terms appear in the search result (*technical* **AND** *writer*)
 - **OR** combines terms so that at least one of the listed terms appears in the search result (*writer* **OR** *writing*)
 - **NOT** excludes the subsequent terms from the search result (*writer* **NOT** *tutoring*)

More powerful filtering techinques include _phrase_ and _query matching_ expressions.
 - **Phrase search** uses quotes around terms so that the exact phrase appears in the search result (**"**_technical writer_**"**) 
 - **Query matching** uses a query expression to limit search to a specific category, such as job title (**title:** _writer_) 

Combining these techniques, we can create very powerful examples. Checkout the search below and click the link to see it in action on the site ([link](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=title%3A%28%22technical+writer%22+OR+%22technical+editor%22%29++NOT+tutor&l=Seattle%2C+WA&sort=date)).
```
title:("technical writer" OR "technical editor")  NOT tutor
```

Evident in this specific search, unwanted words have been filtered out (tutor) that might have popped up had we not employed this Boolean search command. To further strengthen a job search query, you could add more phrases or categories, ("entry level" OR "full time"). 

Boolean search commands are pretty straightforward once you learn how to implement them in a specific search. These commands have been very useful to me personally in my job search (I'm on Indeed.com all the time hunting away) - I hope they can assist you!
