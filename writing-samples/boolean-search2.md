How to Use Boolean Search to Find Your Next Job

Searching for a job is no easy task. On most job listing sites, there can be thousands of potential opportunities posted, many of which are not relevant to your career plans. Reviewing each of these listings is a time consuming process and it's all too easy to accidentally pass on a promising post. Luckily, there is an easy way to filter out unwanted listings by employing Boolean search operators.

What Are Boolean Search Operators?

Boolean search operators modify a search to deliver more tailored results, thereby saving time and improving search efficiency.

By utilizing Boolean search operators, you can perform the following:
- Narrow or broaden a search
- Filter a search to include phrases and key words
- Combine multiple searches 

The key to using Boolean searches are the three basic operators: AND, OR, and NOT.
- AND combines terms so that all the listed terms appear in the search result (technical AND writer)
- OR combines terms so that at least one of the listed terms appears in the search result (writer OR writing)
- NOT excludes the subsequent terms from the search result (writer NOT tutoring)

In addition to Boolean searches, more powerful filtering techniques include phrase and query matching expressions.
- Phrase search uses quotes around terms so that the exact phrase appears in the search result ("technical writer")
- Query matching uses a query expression to limit search to a specific category, such as job title (title: writer)

By combining these techniques, we can create very powerful examples:

title:("technical writer" OR "technical editor")  NOT tutor

[This search on Indeed] would return any postings for technical writers or technical editors, but exclude any that are actually just tutoring roles. If you were also looking for roles that were specifically full time roles, you could include `("entry level" OR "full time") NOT contract.`. [This query on Indeed] returns fewer, but more likely relevant results.

Boolean searches are a simple but powerful tool. Once you learn to incorporate them into your job search, you can use the time you save to work on your applications. Happy searching!
