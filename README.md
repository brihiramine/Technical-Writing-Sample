# Boolean Search - Technical Writing Sample
**Author:** Bri Hiramine Latimer

#### What are Boolean Search Commands
Today we are going to introduce key Boolean Search Commands (also known as Operators) and how they can modify a search to deliver more specific results, thereby saving time and improving search efficiency. We will use Indeed.com as an example, as I have been using it a lot lately to find a new job. Our search will focus on what I am looking for: technical writing roles.

#### Commands and Usage
Boolean Search Commands give us the following key skills. 
   - Narrow or broaden a search
   - Filter a search to include phrases and key words
   - Combine multiple searches so you donâ€™t have to hunt for results independently 

Boolean search is comprised of 3 main basic operations: AND, OR, and NOT.
 - **AND** combines terms so that all the listed terms appear in the search result (*technical* **AND** *writer*)
 - **OR** combines terms so that at least one of the listed terms appears in the search result (*writer* **OR** *writing*)
 - **NOT** excludes the subsequent terms from the search result (writer **NOT** *tutoring*)

More powerful filtering techinques include phrase and query matching expressions.
 - **Phrase search** uses quotes around terms so that the exact phrase appears in the search result (**"**_technical writer_**"**)
 - **Query matching** uses a query expression to limit search to a specific category, such as job title (**title:** _writer_)

Combining these techniques, we can create very powerful examples ([Indeed link](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=title%3A%28%22technical+writer%22+OR+%22technical+editor%22%29++NOT+tutor&l=Seattle%2C+WA&sort=date)).
```
title:("technical writer" OR "technical editor")  NOT tutor
```
